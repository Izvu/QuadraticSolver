Discriminate Spikes Directory

Run make in your command line with these options:

"No Options": The makefile will compile an executable for the discriminate.c source to run which will be "a.out"

Run: The makefile will compile an executable for the discriminate.c source to run which will be "a.out", and run a.out

Clean: The makefile will delete all object files created to compile the discriminate.c source code

The discriminate.c in this directory will allow the user to enter quadratic values for A, B, and C (INF, -INF, and NAN are acceptable input).

The program will evaluate the discriminate and notify user of real roots, double roots, complex roots, NAN, INF, and -INF results.
