Run make in your command line with these options:
	NaN:  The makefile will compile an executable for the nan.c source to run which will be "nan.out", and nan.out
	INF: The makefile will compile an executable for the inf.c source to run which will be "inf.out", and run inf.out
	Norm: The makefile will compile an executable for the norm.c source to run which will be "norm.out", and run norm.out 
	Clean: The makefile will delete all object files created to compile the source code

The header file math.h contains macro defininitons for INF's and NaN. 

The nan.out will test conditions for NaN.
The inf.out will test conditions for INF & -INF.(Infinity and negative infinity)
The norm.out will take in a,b,c and test the accuracy of the answer.

The programs will ask for user input. Follow the instructions on the screen as prompted.
